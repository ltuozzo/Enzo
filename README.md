# Enzo
This is the beginnings of a game I wrote in 2019, using Unity and C#. It's an endless 2D sidescroller, focused on precise platforming. As the players reach certain milestones, new characters would be unlocked, each with different skills that would allow the player to solve the same challenge in different ways. It's called Enzo for no particular reason. I just liked the idea of all characters being squares and their names having only four letters.

The goal of this game was to solve two different challenges. The first one was designing a game with an evolving level design. The game would be made of only a handfull of levels, but each level would gain additional traps and enemies as the player progresses. The second was creating an interesting platforming experience with a minimalistic input design, to be able to publish the game for mobile platforms. To accomplish this, only two inputs were allowed. Tapping the left side of the screen made the character jump to the left and start moving in that direction. Tapping on the right would do the same to the right.

Unfortunately, creating satisfying physics and movement for the player was as far as I got before work related issues got in the way and I had to suspend my progress on this game. I'm hoping to be able to come back to it eventually.
